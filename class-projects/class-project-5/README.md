# Class Project 5: Next.js - Dynamic routes, data fetching

This task is based on the instructions you will be given during the labs. 

> Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need help or assistance (remember, we encourage _fail-fast_ principle).

**Project Tasks:**

1. **Implement Dynamic Routes:**
   - Utilize Next.js to create [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) for blog posts (or alternatively your own resources like products).
   - Implement dynamic routing to handle posts or products index page and individual posts/product pages.

2. **Server-Side Data Fetching**
   - Integrate [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free online REST API, to fetch fake product data dynamically. Alternatively, use your own REST API server.
   - Use [server-side data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating) methods to retrieve product information from JSONPlaceholder and populate the blog pages with realistic fake data.
   - _Optionally (for more experienced):_ Try to implement pagination.

3. **Deploy to Vercel or Netlify:**
   - Re-deploy your updated webpage to Vercel or Netlify for public access.
   - Test the working of dynamic routes.
