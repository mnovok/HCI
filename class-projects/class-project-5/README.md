   - Do make use of ChatGPT for your project to speed this task up. Provide it with some context: personas, sitemap, description, developed in the previous tasks. Then ask it to propose design requirements and content outline for your page.
   - **Example prompts**:
     - _Propose  design requirements for a landing page._
     - _Give content outline for my landing page._
     - _Suggest short text for my hero section._

2. **Design Principles and Guidelines:**
   - Apply fundamental design principles, including consistency, readability, and visual hierarchy, to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.
   - In particular, try to apply CRAP principles for visual design.
  
  > HINT: Do not try to perfect your design at this stage. Design is an iterative process and at this stage it is important to move fast, fail and re-iterate. In this way, you are more likely to explore different possibilities and alternatives.
